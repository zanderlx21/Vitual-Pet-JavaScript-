# Virtual Pet
Virtual Pet (JavaScript)

This was part 2 of my entry project before being admitted into Grand Circus Bootcamp.

I was tasked to create a virtual pet that responded to being Fed, Walked, or Pet..with a point system to measure its happiness & energy.

This was my first time working with JavaScript!
